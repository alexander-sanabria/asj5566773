### 📚 About Me 💻
In 2017, I began my pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Global Liberal Studies at New York University with the intention of going to Law School one day. I engaged in discussion-based seminars, conducted independent research projects, and participated in experiential learning activities, all of which equipped me with a solid foundation in critical thinking and analysis. However, recognizing the increasing demand for cybersecurity professionals and my keen interest in protecting digital assets, I made a deliberate transition to the field by enrolling in the Emory Cyber Bootcamp. This transformative experience not only allowed me to leverage my analytical strengths in new ways but also provided a focused environment to hone those skills specifically within the context of information security.

In the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity, my time at the Emory Cyber Bootcamp, powered by Fullstack Academy, was a transformative journey that delved into various facets of the field. Navigating the complexities of network fundamentals, the curriculum provided hands-on experience and practical insights into TCP/IP, OSI model, subnetting, VLANs, and firewall configurations. Techniques such as protocol analysis, routing protocols, and network architectures were thoroughly explored, utilizing tools like Wireshark for in-depth packet capture. Simultaneously, the program fostered blue team proficiency, covering security standards, frameworks, policies, and security awareness and training. This blue team focus equipped me with the skills to defend against cyber threats. Furthermore, the curriculum extended to red team operations, where the emphasis was on threat modeling, intelligence gathering, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing. In this realm, I gained hands-on experience with tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, SIEMs, Wireshark, and Nmap, crucial for simulating attacks and identifying vulnerabilities. This multifaceted education provided a comprehensive foundation, seamlessly integrating network fundamentals with both red and blue team operations.

Beyond the bootcamp, I've consistently reinforced my skills by actively engaging in ongoing blue team practices on platforms like LetsDefend & Cybrary, tackling hands-on red team challenges through HacktheBox Academy & TryHackMe, and delving into studying Python and writing my own scripts. Combining my academic foundation from New York University, intensive training at the Emory Cyber Bootcamp, and consistent self-study, I've cultivated a unique skill set that seamlessly merges analytical prowess with a profound understanding of cybersecurity.
